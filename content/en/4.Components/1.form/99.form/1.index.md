The basic usage of the `Form` component involves defining the form structure and binding the form field values using the `v-model` directive.

## Structure

The `structure` prop defines the structure of the form, including fields and layout settings. It is an array of sections, where each section can contain multiple fields and have its own layout settings.

### Structure Properties

Each section in the structure can have the following properties:

- **fields**: Array of fields in the section.
- **[key: string]**: Additional custom properties for the section.
- **isHidden**: Indicates whether the section is hidden.
- **class**: Custom CSS class for the section.
- **classGrid**: CSS class for the grid layout of the section.

### Structure fields

This example shows a simple form with `username`, `email`, and `password` fields, built using the `<Form>` component. 
The fields are dynamically generated and support localization for labels and placeholders.

### Structure custom properties

This example showcases a form where you can define a custom structure with additional properties like titles, descriptions, or any other fields you need. 
These properties can then be flexibly arranged and styled using a custom template slot, allowing full control over their presentation.

## Field

The `field` parameter is an object within the `fields` array of a `structure`, representing a single input element in a form. It combines basic properties like `type`, `name`, and `label` with optional settings to tailor its look and functionality, making it a core piece of any form section.

### Field Properties

Each field can be customized with properties like these:

- **typeComponent**: Defines the component type, such as "Input" or "Select".
- **name**: Sets the field’s identifier, linking it to the form’s data.
- **isHidden**: Controls whether the field is visible or hidden.
- **insert**: Adds icons or text before or after the field for extra context.
- **classCol**: Applies a custom CSS class for layout styling.
- **rules**: Specifies validation rules to ensure correct input.

### Field Type

The `typeComponent` property lets you choose the kind of input field to use. Each component type comes with its own set of customizable parameters, giving you flexibility to adapt it to your needs. Below is a list of available components and their APIs:

::callout{to="/components/form/input/api" icon="gravity-ui:abbr-api"}
**Input**  
<br/>

### Field Hidden

The `isHidden` property lets you control whether a specific field is visible within the form. By setting it to `true`, you can hide the field from the user, while `false` (or leaving it undefined) keeps it displayed. This simple yet powerful option is perfect for conditionally showing fields based on user input, form state, or other dynamic conditions.

::preview

::

### Field Insert

The `insert` property allows you to enhance a field by adding icons or text before or after it. With options like `beforeIcon`, `beforeText`, `afterIcon`, and `afterText`, you can easily provide visual cues or extra context to improve the user experience. This feature is great for making fields more intuitive and visually appealing.

### Field classCol

The `classCol` property lets you apply a custom CSS class to the column area of each input field, giving you control over its individual styling and layout. This is a handy way to adjust the appearance or positioning of specific fields within the form to match your design needs.

## Field Rules

The `rules` property is a powerful feature of the `field` object that lets you define validation logic for form inputs. It ensures that user-entered data meets specific requirements before submission. You can use it as either an array of rule objects or a single object with rule types as keys, offering flexibility to suit different validation needs.

::preview
<DemoFormFieldRules/>

### Overview

Validation rules help maintain data integrity by checking field values against predefined conditions. Each rule can include a custom error message, an activation toggle, and type-specific parameters. Rules are processed in order, and the first failed rule triggers an error message for the user.

### Rule Formats

The `rules` property supports two formats:

- **Object Format**: A key-value structure where keys are rule types (e.g., `required`, `email`) and values define the rule’s behavior or message.
- **Array Format**: A list of rule objects, each with a `type` and additional settings, allowing for more complex or sequential validation.

Both formats are internally converted to an array for consistent processing.

### Available Rule Types

Here’s a breakdown of the supported rule types and their purposes:

- **required**: Ensures the field is not empty.
    - *Example*: `{ required: "This field is required" }`
- **email**: Validates that the input is a properly formatted email address.
    - *Example*: `{ email: "Invalid email format" }`
- **phone**: Checks if the input matches a valid phone number format.
    - *Example*: `{ phone: "Invalid phone number" }`
- **numeric**: Confirms the input contains only numbers.
    - *Example*: `{ numeric: "Must be a number" }`
- **regular**: Tests the input against a regular expression or string pattern.
    - *Parameters*: `regular` (RegExp or string)
    - *Example*: `{ regular: { regular: /^[A-Z]/, message: "Must start with a capital letter" } }`
- **range**: Ensures the numeric input falls within a specified min/max range.
    - *Parameters*: `min`, `max`
    - *Example*: `{ range: { min: 1, max: 100, message: "Value must be between 1 and 100" } }`
- **length**: Validates the input length against min/max constraints.
    - *Parameters*: `min`, `max`
    - *Example*: `{ length: { min: 3, max: 10, message: "Must be 3-10 characters" } }`
- **async**: Runs an asynchronous validation function, useful for server-side checks.
    - *Parameters*: `validationCallback` (returns a Promise)
    - *Example*: `{ async: { validationCallback: async (value) => ({ isInvalid: value === "test", message: "Value not allowed" }) } }`
- **custom**: Applies a custom synchronous validation function.
    - *Parameters*: `validationCallback` (returns `{ isInvalid, message }`)
    - *Example*: `{ custom: { validationCallback: (value) => ({ isInvalid: value < 0, message: "Must be positive" }) } }`
- **compare**: Compares the field’s value with other form fields.
    - *Parameters*: `compareFields` (array of field names), `validationCallback`
    - *Example*: `{ compare: { compareFields: ["password"], validationCallback: (value, fields) => ({ isInvalid: value !== fields.password, message: "Passwords don’t match" }) } }`

### Rule Properties

Each rule can include these optional properties:

- **message**: A custom error message displayed when the rule fails. Defaults are provided if omitted (e.g., "Required field" for `required`).
- **isActive**: A boolean to enable or disable the rule (defaults to `true`).

### How Rules Work

Rules are evaluated when the form validates a field. For synchronous rules (like `required` or `email`), validation happens immediately using built-in methods. For `async` rules, a separate asynchronous check is performed. If any rule fails, validation stops, and the associated error message is returned.

### Usage Tips

- Use the object format for simple, single-rule fields (e.g., `{ required: true }`).
- Switch to the array format for multiple rules or complex logic (e.g., `[{ type: "required" }, { type: "email" }]`).
- Leverage `custom` or `async` for advanced scenarios like API calls or unique business logic.
- Combine `compare` with other fields to enforce relationships, such as matching passwords.

The `rules` property gives you full control over form validation, balancing simplicity for basic checks with depth for sophisticated requirements.

## Form Values

The `formValues` object is the heart of data management in your form, holding the current values of all fields. Paired with the `v-model:formFields` directive on the `<Form>` component, it enables seamless two-way data binding, allowing you to both set initial values and capture user input in real time.

::preview{class="p-0"}
<DemoFormModelValues/>
::

### What is `formValues`?

The `formValues` object is a reactive structure that mirrors the fields defined in your form’s `structure`. Each key in `formValues` corresponds to a field’s `name` property, and its value reflects what the user has entered—or what you’ve predefined. This object is passed to the `<Form>` component via the `v-model:formFields` directive, creating a dynamic link between the UI and your data.

For example, in a form with fields named `username`, `email`, and `password`, the `formValues` object might look like this conceptually:
- `username: "john_doe"`
- `email: "john@example.com"`
- `password: "secret123"`

### How It Works

When you bind `formValues` to the `<Form>` component using `v-model:formFields`, two things happen:

1. **Initialization**: The form fields are populated with the initial values from `formValues`. If a field’s `name` matches a key in `formValues`, its value is set accordingly. Unmatched fields start empty or with their default settings.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: As the user interacts with the form—typing, selecting options, or toggling switches—the `formValues` object updates instantly to reflect these changes. This two-way binding ensures your data stays in sync with the UI without manual intervention.

The syntax looks like this in practice:
```vue
<Form :structure="structure" v-model:formFields="formValues"/>
```
Here, `structure` defines the fields, while `formValues` tracks their values.

### Setting Up `formValues`

To use `formValues`, you typically define it as a reactive reference in your component’s setup:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const formValues = ref({
  username: '',
  email: '',
  password: ''
})
const structure = ref([{ fields: [/* field definitions */] }])
</script>
```

- **Initial Values**: Set default values in `formValues` to prefill the form (e.g., `username: "john_doe"`).
- **Dynamic Updates**: As the user types, `formValues.value.username` updates automatically.

### Why Use `v-model:formFields`?

The `v-model:formFields` directive is what makes this binding possible. It’s a custom modifier tailored for the `<Form>` component, linking each field’s `name` to its corresponding value in `formValues`. This approach:
- Simplifies state management by centralizing all field data in one object.
- Enables reactive updates without extra event handlers.
- Supports complex forms with nested fields or multiple sections.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Preloading Data**: Load existing user data into `formValues` to edit profiles or records.
- **Form Submission**: Access `formValues` directly when submitting the form—no need to manually collect input values.
- **Conditional Logic**: Use `formValues` to show or hide fields dynamically with `isHidden` based on other field values.

### Tips for Success

- **Match Field Names**: Ensure every field’s `name` in `structure` has a corresponding key in `formValues` to avoid mismatches.
- **Reactivity**: Wrap `formValues` in `ref()` (or use `reactive()`) to maintain Vue’s reactivity.
- **Default Values**: Provide empty strings or appropriate defaults (e.g., `''`, `false`, `[]`) to prevent undefined errors.

The `formValues` object, combined with `v-model:formFields`, gives you a straightforward yet powerful way to manage form data, making your forms both interactive and easy to work with.

## Validate mode

The `modeValidate` prop determines when and how the form fields are validated, giving you control over the user experience during form interaction. It accepts one of three values: `onSubmit`, `onChange`, or `onInput`, each tailoring the validation timing to suit different scenarios.


### Understanding Validation Modes

Validation is a critical part of form usability—it ensures data correctness while providing feedback to users. The `modeValidate` prop lets you decide *when* this validation happens, balancing between immediate feedback and performance considerations. Here’s how each mode works:

- **`onSubmit`**: Validation triggers only when the form is submitted. This mode delays feedback until the user finishes filling out the form, making it ideal for reducing distractions during input and focusing on final data integrity.
- **`onChange`**: Validation occurs whenever a field’s value changes and the field loses focus (e.g., when the user clicks away). This provides feedback after each field is completed, offering a middle ground between responsiveness and minimal interruption.
- **`onInput`**: Validation runs instantly as the user types or interacts with a field. This mode delivers real-time feedback, perfect for guiding users as they go but potentially more resource-intensive for complex forms.

### How to Use `modeValidate`

You set the `modeValidate` prop directly on the `<Form>` component.

```vue
<Form 
    modeValidate="onSubmit"
    :structure="structure" 
    v-model:formFields="formValues">
</Form>
```

This configuration ties the validation behavior to the entire form, applying the chosen mode to all fields defined in `structure`. The `rules` property of each field (see [Field Rules](#field-rules)) then dictates what’s validated, while `modeValidate` controls when.

### Diving Deeper into Each Mode

#### On Submit

::preview
<DemoFormModeValidateSubmit/>
::

- **Behavior**: No validation happens during input or editing—errors only appear when the user submits the form.
- **Use Case**: Best for simple forms where users prefer to complete everything before seeing errors, such as login or registration forms.
- **Pros**: Reduces UI clutter and CPU usage during input.
- **Cons**: Users might not notice issues until the end, requiring corrections after submission attempts.

#### On Change

::preview
<DemoFormModeValidateChange/>
::

- **Behavior**: Validation kicks in after a field’s value changes and it loses focus. For instance, typing in an email field won’t trigger validation until the user tabs out or clicks elsewhere.
- **Use Case**: Great for forms where users need periodic feedback without constant interruption, like profile editing or settings pages.
- **Pros**: Balances responsiveness with a less aggressive validation approach.
- **Cons**: Delayed feedback compared to `"onInput"`, which might confuse users expecting instant checks.

#### On Input
::preview
<DemoFormModeValidateInput/>
::

- **Behavior**: Validation fires with every keystroke or interaction (e.g., typing, selecting a dropdown option). Errors update live as the user works.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for fields requiring immediate correction, such as password strength checks or real-time format validation (e.g., phone numbers).
- **Pros**: Offers the fastest feedback, enhancing user guidance.
- **Cons**: Can feel overwhelming if error messages pop up too frequently, and may impact performance in forms with many fields or complex rules.

### Choosing the Right Mode

Your choice of `modeValidate` depends on the form’s purpose and user experience goals:
- Use `"onSubmit"` for a clean, uninterrupted filling process where final validation suffices.
- Opt for `"onChange"` when users benefit from feedback after completing each field, without real-time pressure.
- Select `"onInput"` for highly interactive forms where instant validation improves accuracy or usability.

### Practical Example

Imagine a registration form with `username`, `email`, and `password` fields:
- With `modeValidate="onSubmit"`, users can type freely, and errors (e.g., "Email invalid") only show on submit.
- With `modeValidate="onChange"`, finishing the `email` field and tabbing out triggers a check, showing "Email invalid" if needed.
- With `modeValidate="onInput"`, typing an invalid email like "abc" shows the error immediately, adjusting as the user corrects it to "abc@example.com".

### Tips for Implementation

- **Combine with Rules**: Ensure your field `rules` are well-defined (e.g., `{ email: true }`) to make validation meaningful regardless of mode.
- **Performance**: For large forms with `"onInput"`, test for lag—consider `"onChange"` if performance dips.
- **User Feedback**: Pair `modeValidate` with clear error messaging (via `rules.message`) to guide users effectively.

The `modeValidate` prop empowers you to fine-tune when validation occurs, aligning the form’s behavior with both user expectations and application needs.
