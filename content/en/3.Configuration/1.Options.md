## Configuration Object

FishtVue provides a configuration object for application-wide settings.

```ts
export declare interface FishtVueConfiguration {
  componentsStyle?: StyleMode
  locale?: Locales
  theme?: Theme
  optionsTheme?: OptionsTheme
  componentsOptions?: ComponentsOptions
}
```

## Import

Configuration is managed by the FishtVue instance imported from `fishtvue/config`.

```ts
import FishtVue from 'fishtvue/config';
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, { /* options */ });
```

## Theme

Style mode offers theming based on a design token-based architecture. See the styled mode documentation for details such as building your own theme.

```ts
import FishtVue from 'fishtvue/config';
import Aura from '@fishtvue/themes/aura';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, {
    theme: {
        preset: Aura,
        options: {
            prefix: 'p',
            darkModeSelector: 'system',
            cssLayer: false
        }
    }
});
```

## Unstyled

Unstyled mode instructs the components not to add any built-in style classes so that they can be styled using custom CSS or libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Visit Unstyled mode documentation for more information.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, { unstyled: true });
```

## Pass Through

Defines the shared pass-through properties per component type. Visit the Pass Through Props documentation for more information.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, {
    pt: {
        slider: {
            handle: { class: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast' }
        }
    }
});
```

## Pass Through Options

Used to configure the `ptOptions` properties of components and the `usePassThrough` method. The `mergeSections` defines whether the sections from the main configuration get added and the `mergeProps` controls whether to override or merge the defined props. Defaults are true for `mergeSections` and false for `mergeProps`.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, {
    ptOptions: {
        mergeSections: true,
        mergeProps: false
    }
});
```

## Ripple

Ripple is an optional animation for the supported components such as buttons. It is disabled by default and needs to be enabled at your app's entry file (e.g., main.js) during the FishtVue setup.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, { ripple: true });
```

## InputVariant

Input fields come in two styles, default is outlined with borders around the field whereas filled alternative adds a background color to the field. Applying `p-variant-filled` to an ancestor of an input enables the filled style. If you prefer to use filled inputs in the entire application, use a global container such as the document body or the application element to apply the style class. Note that in case you add it to the application element, components that are teleported to the document body such as Dialog will not be able to display filled inputs as they are not a descendant of the application root element in the DOM tree. To resolve this case, set `inputVariant` to filled at FishtVue configuration as well.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, { inputVariant: "filled" });
```

## ZIndex

ZIndexes are managed automatically to make sure layering of overlay components work seamlessly when combining multiple components. Still, there may be cases where you'd like to configure the default values such as a custom layout where header section is fixed. In a case like this, dropdown needs to be displayed below the application header but a modal dialog should be displayed above. FishtVue configuration offers the `zIndex` property to customize the default values for components categories. Default values are described below and can be customized when setting up FishtVue.

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config";
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(FishtVue, {
    zIndex: {
        modal: 1100,        //dialog, drawer
        overlay: 1000,      //select, popover
        menu: 1000,         //overlay menus
        tooltip: 1100       //tooltip
    }
});
```

## CSP

### Nonce

The nonce value to use on dynamically generated style elements in core.

```ts
app.use(FishtVue, {
    csp: {
        nonce: '...'
    }
});
```

## Locale

### Set Locale

The second parameter of the use function can be used to initiate the locale during FishtVue installation.

```ts
app.use(FishtVue, {
    locale: {
        accept: 'Accept',
        reject: 'Reject',
        //...
    }
});
```

The locale configuration is reactive so that any changes are instantly reflected in the UI. Suppose you are doing a multi-language application and need to change the language dynamically.

```ts
import { defineComponent, onMounted } from "vue";
import { useFishtVue } from "fishtvue/config";

export default defineComponent({
    setup() {
        const changeToSpanish = () => {
            const fishtvue = useFishtVue();
            fishtvue.config.locale.accept = "Aceptar";
            fishtvue.config.locale.reject = "Rechazar";
        }

        onMounted(() => {
            changeToSpanish();
        })
    }
});
```

### Repository

Ready-to-use settings for locales are available at the community-supported FishtLocale repository. We'd appreciate if you could contribute to this repository with pull requests and share it with the rest of the community.

## API

Configuration is managed by the Locale API imported from `fishtvue/config`.
