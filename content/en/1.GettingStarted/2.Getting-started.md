## Implementing a Button

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the Button component.

### 1. Install the library

Install the component from your command line.

::code-group
```npm [npm]
npm install fishtvue
```
```pnpm [pnpm]
pnpm add fishtvue
```
```yarn [yarn]
yarn add fishtvue
```
::

### 2. Initialization of the project

Initializing the FishtVue library in the project

```ts [main.ts]
import { createApp } from "vue"
import FishtVue from "fishtvue/config"
import App from "./App.vue"

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(FishtVue)

app.mount("#app")
```

### 3. Import the Button

Adding the component to the appropriate place with the name.

```vue [App.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
  import Button from "fishtvue/button/Button.vue"
</script>

<template>
  <Button>Open</Button>
</template>

```

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a FishtVue component in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Button component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.
