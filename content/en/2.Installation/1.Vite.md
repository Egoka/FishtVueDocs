## Plugin

FishtVue plugin is required to be installed as an application plugin to set up the default configuration. The plugin is lightweight, and only utilized for configuration purposes.

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import FishtVue from 'fishtvue/config';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(FishtVue);
```

## Theme

Configure FishtVue to use a theme like Aura.

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import FishtVue from 'fishtvue/config';
import Aura from '@fishtvue/themes/aura';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(FishtVue, {
    theme: {
        preset: Aura
    }
});
```

## Verify

Verify your setup by adding a component such as Button. Each component can be imported and registered individually so that you only include what you use for bundle optimization. Import path is available in the documentation of the corresponding component.

```ts
import Button from 'fishtvue/button'

const app = createApp(App);
app.component('Button', Button);
```
